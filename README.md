# 🦜️🔗 LangChain 🤝 Oracle

Welcome to the official repository for LangChain integration with [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://cloud.oracle.com/) and [Oracle AI Vector Search](https://www.oracle.com/database/ai-vector-search/). This project provides native LangChain components for interacting with Oracle's AI services—providing support for **OCI Generative AI**, **OCI Data Science** and **Oracle AI Vector Search**.

## Features

- **LLMs**: Includes LLM classes for OCI services like [Generative AI](https://cloud.oracle.com/ai-services/generative-ai) and [ModelDeployment Endpoints](https://cloud.oracle.com/ai-services/model-deployment), allowing you to leverage their language models within LangChain.
- **Agents**: Includes Runnables to support [Oracle Generative AI Agents](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/agents/), allowing you to leverage Generative AI Agents within LangChain and LangGraph.
- **Vector Search**: Offers native integration with [Oracle AI Vector Search](https://www.oracle.com/database/ai-vector-search/) through a LangChain-compatible components. This enables pipelines that can:
    - Load the documents from various sources using `OracleDocLoader`
    - Summarize content within/outside the database using `OracleSummary`
    - Generate embeddings within/outside the database using `OracleEmbeddings`
    - Chunk according to different requirements using Advanced Oracle Capabilities from `OracleTextSplitter`
    - Store, index, and query vectors using `OracleVS`
- **More to come**: This repository will continue to expand and offer additional components for various OCI and Oracle AI services as development progresses.

> This project merges and replaces earlier OCI and Oracle AI Vector Search integrations from the `langchain-community` repository and unifies contributions from Oracle teams.
> All integrations in this package assume that you have the credentials setup to connect with oci and database services.
